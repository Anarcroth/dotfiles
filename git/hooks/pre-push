# Called by "git push" after it has checked the remote status,
# but before anything has been pushed.
# If this script exits with a non-zero status nothing will be pushed.
#
# This hook is called with the following parameters:
#
# $1 -- Name of the remote to which the push is being done
# $2 -- URL to which the push is being done
#
# If pushing without using a named remote those arguments will be equal.
#
# Information about the commits which are being pushed is supplied as lines to
# the standard input in the form:
#
#   <local ref> <local sha1> <remote ref> <remote sha1>
#
# This hook will:
# 1. Stop pushing if the branch contains a WIP commit
# 2. Stop pushing if the push is going to be a force push to $protected_branches

# Get pre-push variables
