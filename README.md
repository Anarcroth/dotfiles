### What you can find here

Some scripts
  * fgr - Find Git Repos. Goes through a given directory and tries to find if a git repository exists. Helpful when you don't know how many git repositories you have and you want to organize them.

  * ncc - Not Commited Changes. Goes through your git repos and checks if there are un-commited changes.
  * kb-light - Python script to control the keyboard light.
  * keyboardlight - The same thing but in bash.
